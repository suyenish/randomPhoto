# randomPhotoGenerator
Random Photo generator app
Today I have done my very first project on Swift. 
I was doing it by this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuo50-TiKgo.
There are some changes I want to apply on this project.
  1. I want to sort out the background colors, add some new.
  2. I realized that all of this pictures are good profile photos, so I want users to download them through this app.
    2.1. to do so I need to create a button for download
    2.2. to find a good spot for button
  3. Maybe I will create an application's icon
There it is for now. I will try to improve it as soon as possible
